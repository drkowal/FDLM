Title: A Bayesian Multivariate Functional Dynamic Linear Model
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel R. Kowal <daniel.r.kowal@gmail.com>

Description: This package provides an implementation of A Bayesian Multivariate
    Functional Dynamic Linear Model (Kowal, Matteson, Ruppert, JASA, 2017) for modeling 
    a (multivariate) time series of functional data. The model may be described as a 
    dynamic functional factor model: the factor loadings are modeled as smooth curves, 
    while the factors are modeled dynamically as latent state variables in a state space model 
    (or dynamic linear model). The package provides an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm,
    as well as functions for component block sampling steps: (1) the factor loading curves, 
    (2) the state variables (factors) using the package KFAS, and (3) the observation and
    evolution error variances. Modifications of steps (2) and (3) provide a broadly applicable  
    framework for modeling a time series of functional data.
